# nape-js — Multiplayer Implementation Guide

Recommendations and architectural patterns for building real-time multiplayer
games with nape-js. Based on the production multiplayer demo (P52) and the
engine's serialization capabilities.

---

## Architecture: Server-Authoritative

**Recommendation: Always run physics on the server.**

The server owns the simulation. Clients send inputs, the server applies them,
steps the physics world, and broadcasts the resulting state. This is the only
architecture that prevents cheating in competitive games.

```
Client A  ──input──→  Server (nape-js Space)  ──state──→  Client A
Client B  ──input──→        ↓                 ──state──→  Client B
                      space.step(dt)
```

**Why not peer-to-peer?** P2P physics is inherently vulnerable to cheating
(any client can lie about state) and requires lockstep synchronization, which
adds latency equal to the slowest peer. Server-authoritative is the industry
standard for any game where fairness matters.

**Why not client-authoritative?** Each client running its own simulation diverges
due to floating-point non-determinism (see Determinism section below). The server
is the single source of truth.

---

## Server Setup

### Runtime

nape-js is pure TypeScript with zero DOM dependencies — it runs natively on
Node.js without any browser polyfills. The recommended server stack:

| Component | Recommendation | Why |
|-----------|---------------|-----|
| Runtime | **Node.js 18+** | Native ESM, stable `Buffer`, good perf |
| WebSocket | **`ws`** package | Lightweight, binary support, proven at scale |
| HTTP | Node.js built-in `http` | No need for Express/Fastify for WS-only servers |
| Hosting | **Railway** / Fly.io / Render | Single-command deploy, WebSocket support, auto-sleep |

### Railway Deployment

The multiplayer demo uses [Railway](https://railway.app) with this minimal config:

```toml
# railway.toml
[build]
builder = "nixpacks"

[deploy]
startCommand = "node index.js"
```

**Why Railway?** WebSocket-friendly (no timeout issues), free tier available,
auto-deploy from GitHub, simple environment variable management.
Fly.io and Render are equally good alternatives. Avoid serverless platforms
(Vercel, Netlify Functions, AWS Lambda) — they don't support persistent
WebSocket connections.

### Physics Loop

Run the simulation at a fixed timestep, independent of network or render timing:

```javascript
const TICK_HZ = 60;
const TICK_MS = 1000 / TICK_HZ;

setInterval(() => {
  applyPlayerInputs();           // process queued inputs
  space.step(TICK_MS / 1000);    // step physics (seconds)
  const frame = buildStateFrame();
  if (frame) broadcastBinary(frame);
}, TICK_MS);
```

**60 Hz is the recommended tick rate.** This matches standard display refresh,
provides smooth simulation, and the binary delta protocol keeps bandwidth
manageable even at this rate. For less latency-sensitive games (strategy,
puzzle), 20–30 Hz saves bandwidth.

---

## Protocol: JSON + Binary Hybrid

Use JSON for control messages and binary for state frames. This is the optimal
split for bandwidth and developer ergonomics.

### Client → Server (JSON)

```javascript
// Input (sent at 20 Hz — independent of tick rate)
{ type: "input", keys: { left: true, right: false, jump: false } }

// Ping (every 2 seconds)
{ type: "ping" }
```

**Send inputs at 20 Hz (50 ms), not every frame.** Input changes are discrete
(key pressed/released), so 20 Hz captures all transitions with minimal bandwidth.
The server applies the latest input state every tick.

### Server → Client (JSON, on events)

```javascript
// Init packet (once, on connection)
{
  type: "init",
  playerId: 1,
  bodyId: 5,
  staticBodies: [{ x, y, w, h, oneWay }],
  sceneObjects: [{ id, shape, size, x, y }],
  players: [{ id, colorIdx, bodyId }]
}

// Player join/leave
{ type: "players", count: 3, players: [...] }
```

### Server → All (Binary, every tick)

```
[bodyCount: Uint16] + N × [id: Uint16, x: Float32, y: Float32, rot: Float32]
Total: 2 + N × 14 bytes per frame
```

**This is a custom delta protocol**, not the full `spaceToBinary()` serializer.
Only bodies whose position or rotation changed beyond a threshold are included:

```javascript
const POS_THRESHOLD = 0.1;   // pixels
const ROT_THRESHOLD = 0.001; // radians
```

### Bandwidth Budget

| Scenario | Bodies/frame | Bytes/frame | Bytes/sec (60 Hz) | KB/s |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|------|
| 4 players, 10 objects moving | ~14 | 198 | 11,880 | ~12 |
| 8 players, 20 objects moving | ~28 | 394 | 23,640 | ~23 |
| 8 players, all 40 objects | ~48 | 674 | 40,440 | ~40 |

This is well within typical WebSocket budgets. For comparison, most competitive
games use 30–100 KB/s per client.

## JSON vs Binary Serialization

nape-js provides two serialization formats. Choose based on your use case:

| | `spaceToJSON` | `spaceToBinary` | Custom delta protocol |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Payload size** | Largest (~100+ bytes/body) | ~40–60% smaller | Smallest (~14 bytes/body) |
| **Includes userData** | Yes | No | No |
| **Full state restore** | Yes | Yes | No (positions only) |
| **Use case** | Save/load, debugging, replay | Rollback snapshots, full sync | Per-frame state broadcast |
| **Import** | `@newkrok/nape-js/serialization` | `@newkrok/nape-js/serialization` | Hand-written (see demo) |

**Recommendation for multiplayer:**

- **Per-frame sync:** Custom binary delta protocol (only changed body transforms)
- **Full state sync** (on join, reconnect): `spaceToBinary()` or custom init packet
- **Rollback netcode:** `spaceToBinary()` / `spaceFromBinary()` for snapshot/restore
- **Save/load & debugging:** `spaceToJSON()` / `spaceFromJSON()`

### When to Use Full Serialization Over Deltas

The delta protocol only sends position + rotation. If your game needs to
synchronize velocity, angular velocity, or custom body properties, consider:

1. Extending the delta protocol with additional fields
2. Periodic full state sync (e.g., every 5 seconds via `spaceToBinary()`)
3. Using `spaceToJSON()` for debug snapshots during development

---

## Client-Side Interpolation

**The client does NOT run physics.** It receives server state and interpolates
between snapshots for smooth rendering.

### How It Works

```javascript
const TICK_MS = 1000 / 60;
const INTERP_DELAY = TICK_MS * 1.5;  // 25 ms buffer

function interpolate(state, now) {
  if (!state.ts || !state.pts || state.ts <= state.pts) return state;

  const renderTime = now - INTERP_DELAY;
  const alpha = Math.max(0, Math.min(1,
    (renderTime - state.pts) / (state.ts - state.pts)
  ));

  return {
    x:   state.px + (state.x - state.px) * alpha,
    y:   state.py + (state.y - state.py) * alpha,
    rot: state.prot + (state.rot - state.prot) * alpha,
  };
}
```

### Key Concepts

- **Interpolation delay (1.5× tick):** The client renders 25 ms behind the
  latest server frame. This ensures there are always two snapshots available to
  interpolate between, even with network jitter.

- **Per-body timestamps:** Each body stores when its last two snapshots arrived.
  This handles cases where bodies update at different rates (e.g., sleeping
  bodies send no updates).

- **No extrapolation:** When a frame is late, the client holds the last known
  position rather than guessing. Extrapolation causes visible snap-back when
  the real frame arrives.

### Visual Latency

Total visual latency = network RTT/2 + interpolation delay (~25 ms):

| Ping | One-way latency | + Interp delay | Total visual delay |
|------|----------------|----------------|--------------------|
| 20 ms | 10 ms | 25 ms | ~35 ms |
| 60 ms | 30 ms | 25 ms | ~55 ms |
| 120 ms | 60 ms | 25 ms | ~85 ms |

For most games, <100 ms total delay feels responsive. Competitive FPS games need
<50 ms, but physics platformers/sandbox games are comfortable at 50–100 ms.

---

## Client-Side Prediction (Advanced)

The multiplayer demo does **not** use client-side prediction — pure interpolation
is sufficient for its platformer gameplay at 60 Hz. However, prediction becomes
important for:

- Competitive games where input responsiveness is critical
- High-latency environments (>100 ms RTT)
- Games where the player's own character must feel instant

### How Prediction Works

1. Client runs a local nape-js `Space` with only the player's body
2. On input, immediately apply it locally AND send to server
3. Store input history with sequence numbers
4. When server state arrives, rewind to the server's confirmed frame
5. Re-apply unconfirmed inputs on top of the server state
6. Smooth any correction (server vs predicted position) over a few frames

### Prediction with nape-js

```javascript
// Save state for rollback
import { spaceToBinary, spaceFromBinary } from '@newkrok/nape-js/serialization';

// Snapshot before applying unconfirmed inputs
const snapshot = spaceToBinary(localSpace);

// On server correction: restore and re-simulate
const correctedSpace = spaceFromBinary(snapshot);
for (const input of unconfirmedInputs) {
  applyInput(correctedSpace, input);
  correctedSpace.step(TICK_MS / 1000);
}
```

**Important:** nape-js is NOT guaranteed to be deterministic across platforms
(see P48). Prediction works best when client and server run on the same platform
(e.g., both Chrome V8). Minor floating-point differences will be corrected by
the server authoritative state.

---

## Determinism Considerations

### Soft Determinism (P48)

nape-js supports **same-platform deterministic simulation** via the
`space.deterministic` flag:

```ts
const space = new Space(Vec2.weak(0, 400));
space.deterministic = true; // opt-in
```

When enabled, all internal iteration orders (bodies, constraints, arbiters,
islands) are sorted by stable IDs, guaranteeing identical results across
runs on the same browser/OS given the same inputs.

### What This Means for Multiplayer

| Architecture | Determinism needed? | nape-js support |
|---|---|---|
| Server-authoritative (recommended) | No | Full support |
| Client-side prediction + server reconciliation | Soft (same platform) | **Full support** (`deterministic = true`) |
| Lockstep (P2P) | Hard (cross-platform) | Not recommended |
| Rollback netcode (GGPO-style) | Soft (same platform) | **Full support** (`deterministic = true` + binary snapshots) |

### Limitations

- **Cross-platform:** `Math.sin`/`Math.cos` precision and IEEE 754 rounding
  may differ between JS engines (V8 vs SpiderMonkey vs JavaScriptCore).
  True cross-platform bit-exact determinism (like Rapier's WASM approach)
  is impractical in pure JavaScript.
- **Performance:** ~1-5% overhead on `step()` when deterministic mode is enabled.
  Zero overhead when disabled (default).
- **Same-platform requirement:** For prediction/rollback, ensure client and
  server run on the same JS engine (e.g., both on V8/Node.js).

---

## Connection Management

### Reconnection

Always implement auto-reconnect. Players will lose connection due to network
switches (WiFi→cellular), brief outages, or server restarts:

```javascript
ws.onclose = () => {
  setTimeout(connect, 3000);  // retry after 3 seconds
};
```

On reconnect, the server should send a fresh init packet with full scene state.
The client discards stale state and re-initializes.

### Spectator Mode

When the server reaches max capacity, accept additional connections as
read-only spectators. They receive binary state frames but cannot send input:

```javascript
if (players.size >= MAX_PLAYERS) {
  // Send init with spectator: true, no physics body created
  spectators.add(ws);
}
```

### Player Capacity

The multiplayer demo supports 8 concurrent players. Scaling considerations:

| Players | Bodies (typical) | Binary frame | CPU (60 Hz) |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1–8 | 20–50 | <1 KB/frame | Negligible |
| 8–32 | 50–200 | 1–3 KB/frame | Low |
| 32–100 | 200–500 | 3–7 KB/frame | Moderate |
| 100+ | 500+ | Consider spatial partitioning | See below |

For >32 players, consider:
- **Interest management:** Only send bodies near each player (spatial query)
- **Lower tick rate** for distant objects
- **Multiple rooms/instances** on separate `Space` objects

---

## Performance Tips

### Server-Side

1. **Use `isBullet = true`** for player bodies — enables CCD (continuous
   collision detection) to prevent tunneling at high velocities

2. **Delta encoding matters.** Only send bodies that actually moved. The
   threshold-based approach (0.1 px / 0.001 rad) skips sleeping and
   near-stationary bodies, often reducing frame size by 50–80%

3. **One-way platforms** via `PreListener` — inspect the collision normal
   direction to decide ACCEPT/IGNORE. This is computed server-side only

4. **Avoid creating/destroying bodies per-frame.** Pool and reuse bodies.
   Body creation triggers broadphase insertion which is O(log n)

### Client-Side

1. **Don't run `space.step()` on the client** unless doing prediction.
   Just interpolate the server-provided transforms

2. **Store previous + current position** per body for interpolation. Don't
   interpolate globally — per-body timestamps handle variable update rates

3. **Input debouncing:** Send inputs at 20 Hz, not on every keydown event.
   This prevents flooding the server with redundant messages

---

## Security

### Origin Validation

Always validate WebSocket connection origins to prevent unauthorized access:

```javascript
const ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
  "https://yourdomain.com",
  "http://localhost:5500",
];

const wss = new WebSocketServer({
  server: httpServer,
  verifyClient: ({ origin }) => ALLOWED_ORIGINS.some(o => origin === o),
});
```

### Input Validation

Never trust client input. The server should:

- Ignore invalid message formats (wrap parsing in try/catch)
- Cap movement speed server-side (don't let clients set arbitrary velocity)
- Apply jump cooldowns server-side (the demo uses 10 frames / ~167 ms)
- Rate-limit input messages (drop excess messages beyond 30/sec)

### Anti-Cheat

Server-authoritative architecture is the primary anti-cheat measure. The client
never owns physics state — it only sends button presses. Even a modified client
cannot teleport, speed-hack, or clip through walls because the server computes
all physics.
